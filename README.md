# Run details:
- Java > 21 version required
- Gradle 8.5 version
- Build: `./gradlew shadowJar`
- Run: `java -jar build/libs/monzo-web-crawler-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar n startUrl`, where `n` is the thread factor (up to 10), `startUrl`is domain that we want to crawl

# Description:
- Start and base urls can be provided in the run vars 
- The system preloads all URLs beginning with 'https://monzo.com/' into a concurrent queue at the start and uses only those URLs that begin with that prefix.
- Parallelism is controlled via the Java Executor service to simplify multithreading execution.
- The service outputs the target URL and a list of links found on that page as stated in the task (console print).
- Output example:
```
- Current url https://www.bbc.co.uk/, amount of links 143, page urls [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9904dz73pyo, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cr40w43gvg1t,

- The tested timeframe to execute a full crawl of 'https://monzo.com/' is around 30 minutes with a parallel factor of 5.

# Implementation details:
- Thread-safe synchronized queue to poll and add to the job queue of URLs that should be processed.
- The service checks if a URL is already in the queue or has been processed and skips such URLs.
- The service ignores URLs that point to resources such as images (jpeg, png, gif).
- The service lacks retries and throttling mechanisms for remote communication.
